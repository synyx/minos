h1. What is Minos?

_Minos_ is a thin framework layer built on "Spring":http://www.springsource.org/, that helps you to develop applications in a modular way. It is concerned with:

* making standard tasks easier by eliminating boilerplate code
* separating distinct layers through modular configuration
* structuring an application into self-contained modules with clear dependency directions

It is thin and lightweight in the sense, that it glues together several libraries and technologies instead of "reinventing the wheel" and augments these in some domains. Following is a list of the used libraries, technologies and augmenting code and their role in the framework:

* "Spring":http://www.springsource.org/ is used for "Dependency Injection":http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html
* "Spring MVC":http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/mvc.html is used, to define request handlers in the form of controller objects
* "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ is used as a build system and - with the help of "WAR overlays":http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html - to assemble applications from multiple [[Minos modules|Modules]]
* "JPA":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html (via "Hibernate's":http://www.hibernate.org/ implementation) is used to define the [[domain model|Domain objects]]
* "Hades":http://hades.synyx.org (currently becoming Spring Data) is used to generate "Data Access Objects (DAO)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object for the domain model
* "Spring Security":http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/springsecurity.html is used in a bundled user management with URL based access control 
* A [[menu system|Menu]] is provided, which allows rendering of hierarchical menus with respect to the security layer  
* "Hera":http://hera.synyx.org, a small plugin system, is used to collect providers for various aspects - for example the menus - from among the Spring beans
* [[Internationalization|Using i18n Module]] support is provided as a modular aspect to simplify localized versions of an application
* "SiteMesh":http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/ is used as a view decoration & layout system for the JSP-based views in _Spring MVC_ 
* Helpful [[Tags]] for form generation or sortable & pageable table views (based on _Hades_ and "DisplayTag":http://displaytag.sf.net/)
* Pre-configured and modular definitions of the web application context (@web.xml@), [[Spring beans|Spring beans configuration]] and [[application properties|Infrastructure configuration]]
